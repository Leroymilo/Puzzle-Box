# Swap!

To play the game, download the latest (with the biggest number) .zip file from the "Archives" folder, extract it and run Swap!.exe.

In case it's not obvious, it's advised to delete the files of the previous version if you're downloading a newer version.

There are instructions in game.


If you want to take a look at the code (Why would you do that? You fool...), you can download the files from the "Experimental" folder,
it should be the latest version of my code.

(The latest version of the code is often already built as a .exe in the latest .zip btw since I build before updating the repository)

/!\ The build.bat will only work if you're on windows and you have all of the needed python library
as well as pyinstaller installed and in the path.

The cool sprites are made by Phanty (the ugly ones are place holders made by me).
The title art is made by my brother.
If someone want to make some music for the game, it would be really cool (it would be paid only if there's enough levels to sell it one day).
